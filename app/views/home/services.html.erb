  For this service we can prepare and carry out a full measured survey and search
  with the Local Authority for further relevant information. We offer design advice
  consultation and visualization sketches prior for plans being drawn for submission.
  We will prepare the proposed drawing related plans by sending the first draft to
  the client for approval before finalizing the layout, so that any minor changes
  can be incorporated in the drawings before issuing to the Local Authority.
  We then prepare all the necessary planning application forms and submit them to
  the Local Authority on your behalf. We can also produce a "Design access statement"
  if it is required. We will monitor your application and liaise with the Local
  Authority till the end of your application being successful. Any drawing amendments
  required by the Local Authority during the application process will be done as
  this is included in our fees. We will liaise with the client if any amendments
